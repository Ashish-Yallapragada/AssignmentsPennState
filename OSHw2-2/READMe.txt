Execution of the first program:

In this program, the multiprocessing.Pipe class is used to create a pipe between the parent and child processes. The parent process sends a message to the child using the send method of the pipe, and the child process reads the message from the pipe, changes the case of each character and adds "CHILD" to the end of the message, then sends the response back to the parent using the send method. The parent process reads the response from the pipe and prints it to the console.

Execution of the second program:

To run the program, first start the server by running the server code in a terminal. Then run the client code in another terminal. The client will prompt you to enter a pair of (x,y) integers and an operator (add, subtract, multiply, divide) or type 'change' to enter new x and y. The client sends the inputs to the server and receives the result, which it then displays. If you enter 'change', the client will prompt you to enter new values for x and y.
